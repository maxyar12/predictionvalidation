The comparison calculator was built with python. It consists of a single function
called comparison which take the inputs and the name of the output file and then produces the
average errors.

My code doesn't really have a whole lot of dependencies, it's fairly simple
I store the data in a dictionary where the stock ID is the key, and then there is an array of arrays holding the actual and predicted price at each hour.

I don't do a whole lot of exception handling here, though I am aware that 
exception handling is important for dealing with real data, I just didn't want to spend
more than a few hours on this because I am very busy finishing my Phd.

I do think exception handling is an important topic for this type of application however.
